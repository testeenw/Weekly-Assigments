First download the unknown thermophile file from github
  wget https://github.com/stechtmann/BL4300-5300/raw/master/data/Weekly_Assignment_data/Unk_therm.faa
Assemble this into a blastable database
  makeblastdb -in Unk_therm.faa -dbtype prot -title Unk_therm
Download the sequence of the heatshock protein given for the weekly assigment 
  wget https://github.com/stechtmann/BL4300-5300/raw/master/data/Weekly_Assignment_data/HSP_prot.fasta
Now you can blast for the HSP in the series of protein file from the unknown thermophile
  blastp -db Unk_therm.faa -query HSP_prot.fasta -out HSP_BLAST.txt -outfmt 7

Questions: 
How many HSPs were found in the unknown organism? 
  Query 1 (sHSP29): 3
  Query 2 (chaperonin): 1
  Query 3 (GroEL): 1
  Query 4 (HSP70): 1
  Query 5 (HSP90): none
  Query 6 (reverse gyrase): 1
  Total possible 7
Provide your justification for how many HSPs were in the organism (use information in the BLAST ouput E-value, length, percent ID, etc).
  All the found HSP had an e value of smaller than 4e-14. Which suggest that these matches were unlikely due to just random chance. 
  Additionally most had a total bit score of over 60. Only 2 of the above had a % identity of around 60
How many HSP have paralogs?
  There is likely only one paralog. Which is between NP_418567.1 and Unk_30. These two sequences share over 60% identity and have an e value of 0 with a bit score of 632
  Paralogs could have been obtained through gene transfer
